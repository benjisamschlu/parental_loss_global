## Parental loss: a global perspective

Scripts for data preparation can't be run because big data sets (hence, not uploadable on Github) are involved.
You should be able to get main outputs on a sample of six countries by starting with the script "kin_dynamics.R". Data needed for that script are in "data" folder. This script will create the object "d_x_t.rda".

You can then run the script "kin_outputs.R" to generate the object "df_results.rda" which contains the outputs of the model.

Once these two scripts have been successfully run, you should have the required objects to be able to generate the Quarto report.
